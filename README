Ok, after the legal stuff I'll describe the program.

It is an implementation of Conway's game "life" on practically unlimited
field by using list of arrays of coordinates. It uses my Inter library for
screen interface. "life.txt" file contains a detailed article in Russian.
The program can be compiled on DOS using Turbo C or DJGPP compilers and on
UNIX (Linux).
